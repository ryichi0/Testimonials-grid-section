## Project Status 
uncompleted

## What I Learned and Continue Learning
In this project I have learned more about designing complicated layouts using css grid

## Challenge
Since each card text has its own colors, it was frustrating to define them one at a time. i wonder if there is a simpler way to set colors for each dark and light mode.
another challenge i faced was in mobile mode, despite the fact that i've already defined grid gap, no gap btw cards does exist in mobile mode. i had to set a margin bottom to make sure cards are not stick together.
